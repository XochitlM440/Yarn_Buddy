input sort by color? Y/N
if yes:
    go to color function

input sort by price?
yardage
weight



color:
    repeat = 1

    while repeat is >0:
    if repeat = 1
        input what color? (list)
    if repeat >1
        say something else
    filter list based on input
    return list
    if list is empty:
        print (not avaialble)
        repeat += 1


all four work the same!
